# Board-Game-Geek-Analysis


For this project I have explored a board game database. I have used supervised regression prediction for the game ratings. This data contains the average rating and the baverage rating which has been affected by the board game geek site to help in anti-skewing of the data. I have used the baverage of this analysis. This rating is a continuous variable. With the use of a pipeline I have found the model best fitted and will use this to make the rating predictions.
